/**
 * Write a class called Group (since Set is already taken). Like Set , it has add ,
delete , and has methods. Its constructor creates an empty group, add adds
a value to the group (but only if it isnâ€™t already a member), delete removes
its argument from the group (if it was a member), and has returns a Boolean
value indicating whether its argument is a member of the group.
