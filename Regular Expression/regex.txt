/xxxx/.test('yyyyy') xxxx is the condition to test and 'yyyy; is where we are testing the conditions
Note: While testing using .test(), all of the conditions must be met if condition is open, i.e, no square bracket
/[xxx]/.test('yyy'):  at least, one of the conditions must be met
Other conditions are /d, /w, /s, /D, /W, /S which are assumed to be inside a square bracket
^: This is used to match for conditions except the one preceded by ^, i.e, string must have other characters apart from
those in the set. Meaning not-conditions
Patterns in expressions folllowed by '+' means elements may be repeated ore that one (>= 1)
Patterns in expressions followed by '*' means (>= 0)
Patterns in expressions followed by '?' means they can occur in the string or not
Patterns in expressions followed by '{x}' means strings must contain matching character at least x times
Adding 'i' at the end of an expression makes it case-insensitive
.test() only check if conditions matches or not. Another method that can be used is .exec() which gives null if not matched
and an object describing the match, if found. Note: It works for only the first match
Having '+' or '*' in the expression tests for first match group
/''/: This tests for quotes
'^' and '$' are known markers. '^' starts a string and '$' ends a string
'\b' is used to check an expression if it starts or end the string. /\bas/ checks the beginning and /as\b/ checks the end
.replace() is used to change values. The first argument is what to change and the second argument is what to change to.
Regular expression can also be used as first argument but matches only the first occurence but if we want effect to take place
in al occurences, we add 'g', meaning global
